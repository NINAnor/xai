# Explainable AI experiments

This folder contains a few experiment for using explanable AI techniques. Most experiments are conducted using the [Kaggle's cats vs dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)

## How to use the folder

- Install the dependancies:

```
poetry install
```

- Train the cats vs dogs classifier model

```
python src/train/cat_dog_classifier.py
```

This will create a `.ckpt` file

- Ask the model to explain its classification!

```
python src/gradcam/vanilla_gradcam.py assets/images/cat.jpeg
```
